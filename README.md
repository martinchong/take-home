This is a take home assignment creating a NextJS blog site using markdowns.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

or go for the build with:

```bash
yarn build
# and
yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start adding .md files to the _posts folder as well as their cover images to public/assets/blog/*. The blog posts should be generated to the website after.

If any of the components seem out of place, that is because for simplicity sake, I used some of my personal code from my personally projects.
